After successfully cloning the project, in order to execute the automation tests it is required to do following:

1.Open the project in IDE(InteliJ) and import all Maven dependencies.

2.After all dependencies are downloaded, in order to start the execution run the 'runTest.xml' file for runing TC_1, TC_2, TC_3, TC_4 and TC_5,  for runing the negTest test case navigate to the "negTest" package -> negTest class and run the test separately driect in the class(I didn't made a xml file because in the package is just one TC).

3.Screen shots will be saved in the Test module (errorScreenshots folder). Send mail functionality is not implemented but in the BaseTest clas you can review the code for it.

4.Txt files will be saved in the "test" module.

NOTE: TC_5 will fail while runing all test cases, navigate to UItestsCases class and run TC_5 (clicking on the run buton TC_5) separate, test should pass.
